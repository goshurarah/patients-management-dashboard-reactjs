# Patients Management
I developed the complete frontend and backend for the Patients Management Web, a healthcare platform built with React, Material-UI, Bootstrap, and CSS. Following Adobe XD designs, I integrated APIs to display patient lists, detailed patient profiles, and health data visualizations such as systolic and diastolic graphs, heart rate, blood pressure, diagnosis history, and lab results. My work ensures seamless API integration, providing an intuitive and data-rich experience for healthcare providers.
